		                            It's been quite a journey, but Renbusi is finally to be released to the public. 
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            Originally I had a concept to develop an MVP for a simple marketing plan creator that would help me fulfill a variety of duties with a few different startups. It quickly grew into so much more. I had wanted to save myself time with some of the consulting work that I was doing, and I just couldn't find anything that suited my needs. Nothing out there would give me what I needed.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>Often when I would create marketing plans and deliver to a startup they would like some pieces, approve a little bit, just to come back a week later and change their minds. The approval process, not to mention the time consuming process of plan creating and change tracking, was often mired in unsure decisions by people who, I believe, just wanted to see more ideas and options.</p>
		                        <blockquote>
		                            I had to save myself time, for the sake of the companies I worked for, and for my own sanity.
		                        </blockquote>
		                        <p>
		                            Once I began development of Renbusi I had to bring in testers. So many testers, so many good ideas. No longer was I developing an MVP to attract investors, I was building a full application to meet the needs of the testers who were actually using the software during development.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>I could write about why I developed this software for years, but, this is my launch notice, so I'll keep it brief. Thank you to all my testers, thank you to my code mentors (Rakim) - and most of all thank you to everyone who will give this thing a shot, I'm sure you'll find it useful.</p>
