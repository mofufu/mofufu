		                           I have gone through a few iterations of marketing plan creation software. I even used to host a version of one on an old blog. The reason I became obsessed with creating a real solution to my problem is that I ran into this same problem over and over again.
		                         </p>  
<p>About 14 or 15 years ago I started working on the side at a healthcare technology company as their marketing website guy. Naturally, this grew into more of a full time thing and I eventually took over the digital marketing department. This was great, except that I had almost no budget and explaining how I wanted to spend the money was becoming more and more difficult. I found myself creating detailed marketing plans, getting them approved, and then when money spending time came, I would have to create a new plan. This is not because the old plan was bad, but it was because they had forgotten what the original plan had contained. When I would present the new plan, the execs at the company would comment that it was the same as the old plan and they wanted new ideas.
</p>
<p>This became an ever-present frustration for my remaining years at this company. So I left. I found other jobs, mostly in the healthcare marketing field. At each of these jobs I found myself facing the same exact problems. Executives didn’t understand the plan, and if they did they would forget about it two days after they had approved it.
</p>
<p>I know that this situation is not present in every marketing department, it’s really a niche problem (as far as I can tell, I might be wrong). A large department has a total budget assigned by the company, and a plan is put into place to spend that budget. When working in a small or medium sized business this is not always the case. We have to beg for money, and to be successful we have to bend over backwards to actually get the money once it’s approved.  
</p>
<p>I needed a way to show everyone exactly how I was targeting my buyer profiles, what my strategy was, and who our competitors were. I also needed a way to add, delete, move around, and otherwise tweak this information easily and always have access to the newest version possible.
</p>
<p>Then I needed a simple way to show how effective each effort (strategy, campaign, whatever) was. For this I needed an easy to understand benchmark. I’m that that everyone reading this article has sat in a meeting or two and tried to describe pages and pages of data and analytics – only to be met with wary glances from people who really don’t care. What I needed to show was how much each lead and customer cost us to acquire. How were those leads captured? Where do they fit into my marketing plan?
</p>
<p>Simple benchmarking was the key, decision makers really only want to see two pieces of information initially – how and why. In a marketing plan this translates pretty simply to budget and benchmark.  Budget your activities, then show how well that money performed. Remove the bad, promote the good – it really seemed to be that simple.
</p>
<p>That’s not to say that data analytics aren’t important, they are important – but only to you as a marketer. Does it do any good to print out a sheet of 5000 keywords from Google Webmaster Tools and give it to your CEO, why should he or she care? Now, if that sheet showed them how much you spent to get there, and how those numbers converted into sales numbers they might be interested.
</p>
<p>This is why I created this software, it took almost 2 months to learn how to code in Rails (luckily I’ve been a front-end developer for many years already) and almost another year of coding and testing to get to the point I’m at today.  I finally have a piece of software that I would use to solve a problem.
</p>
<p>There is still a long way to go for us, but this software currently solves the problem I have had for years. I wouldn’t call it a marketing repository (although we are building that out so you can keep everything in once place along with your plan) – I would call it a living document.
